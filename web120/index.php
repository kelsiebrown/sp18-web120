    <p>My name is Kelsie. I'm a second quarter web development student at Seattle Central College. I have experience with HTML/CSS and Python, and am currently adding JavaScript and PHP/mySQL to my repetoire. So far, I enjoy the programming side of web development but I also have a strong interest in design. I'm currently trying to expand my skills as much as possible to extend my employment opportunities once my program is completed in about a year.</p>
    
    <p>Outside of school, I'm a semi-professional ambient musician. My solo project is called <a href="http://redalder.bandcamp.com">Red Alder</a>. I've self-released several albums and play live when I can. My other hobbies include boxing, hiking & camping, cooking high-end food, and craft beer. I hope to eventually incorporate some of my hobbies into my web development portfolio!</p>
