        <p>Hallo! I’m Rachel. I originally hail from sunny Southern California. After I finished my honours degree in History at the University of Washington and worked for a bit in Seattle, I decided to leave Mexican food and the Standard system behind and packed my bags for Berlin. My love for the city started my third year of University, when I studied Berlin’s history for a semester at the Humboldt University Berlin.</p>

        <p>After living in Berlin for four years, three of those spent as a tour guide, I feel I can give a well rounded and interesting historical perspective to the city’s visitors. I was also raised in a Jewish home and really enjoy helping Jewish visitors to Berlin explore their heritage here. Having specialised in Prussian and Cold War history specifically, trips to Potsdam are always a fun and exciting way to understand another side of German history for me.</p>
